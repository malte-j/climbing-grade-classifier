# Gait-Tracking

Tracks the position of an IMU attached to a subject's foot during walking using Python.  The algorithm uses [Fusion](https://github.com/xioTechnologies/Fusion) to obtain a measurement of acceleration in the Earth coordinate frame from gyroscope and accelerometer data.  The measurement of acceleration is then integrated to obtain a measurement of velocity.  The measurement of velocity is corrected for drift using a zero-velocity detection algorithm and then integrated to obtain the measurement of position.

The repository includes two example datasets collected using an [NGIMU](https://x-io.co.uk/ngimu/).  In both datasets, the subject walks in a loop so that the foot ends at the same location that it started.  The accuracy, evaluated as the final displacement of the foot is 82 mm for a ~25 m walk ([short_walk.csv](https://github.com/xioTechnologies/Gait-Tracking/blob/main/short_walk.csv)), and 421 mm for a ~60 m walk ([long_walk.csv](https://github.com/xioTechnologies/Gait-Tracking/blob/main/long_walk.csv)).  Animations generated for each dataset are available on YouTube and linked to below.
